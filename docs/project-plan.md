- Bubble.io account (starts with free tier)
- Render.com or similar for hosting
- Stripe for payment processing
- GitHub for code repository
- Domain name and email

### Estimated Costs (Monthly)
- MongoDB Atlas: $0 (free tier) → $57+ (paid tier)
- Retool: $0 (free tier) → $10+ per user
- Bubble.io: $0 (free tier) → $25+ (paid plan)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Vector search complexity**: Mitigate by using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search
- **Performance issues**: Mitigate with proper indexing and monitoring
- **Data security**: Mitigate with Atlas security features and proper access controls

### Business Risks
- **Low adoption**: Mitigate by focusing on specific vertical with clear value prop
- **Pricing strategy**: Mitigate by starting with value-based pricing
- **Competitor emergence**: Mitigate by building deep customer relationships

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with a minimal viable product and iterate based on user feedback
- Begin with a small, targeted user base before scaling
- Use managed services to reduce technical complexity
- Focus on solving specific problems completely rather than many problems partially
