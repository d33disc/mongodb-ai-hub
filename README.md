# MongoDB AI Data Hub

A specialized data management system for AI applications, built on MongoDB Atlas with a low-code implementation approach.

## Overview

MongoDB AI Data Hub is a comprehensive solution for storing, organizing, and accessing AI-related data:

- **Prompt Management**: Store, categorize, and reuse AI prompts
- **Vector Embeddings**: Store and search vector embeddings for semantic retrieval
- **RAG System**: Build retrieval-augmented generation systems with your private data
- **Chat History**: Track and analyze AI conversations
- **Web Content**: Store and process web content for AI training and reference

## Why This Exists

AI applications generate and require specialized data that traditional databases aren't optimized to handle. This project provides:

1. **Pre-built data models** optimized for AI workloads
2. **Vector search capabilities** for semantic retrieval
3. **Simple API** for storing and retrieving AI assets
4. **Low-code interfaces** for non-technical users

## Target Users

- Small AI startups who need data infrastructure
- Independent AI developers building custom solutions
- Businesses starting to implement AI without dedicated engineers
- Researchers who need to organize their AI experiments
